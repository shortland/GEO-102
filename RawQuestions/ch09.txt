SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Describe the differences between brittle and ductile deformation.

ANS:	
Brittle deformation occurs in rigid materials or as a result of very high strain rates and produces fractures. Ductile deformation occurs in plastic materials or results of very low strain rates and produces folds and flow in rocks.

DIF:	Easy	REF:	9.2	
OBJ:	Understand how and why rocks deform (crack, bend, or flow) during mountain building.
MSC:	Analyzing

	2.	What types of geologic structures would you expect to find in an area that had undergone compression?

ANS:	
Answers will vary; however, students should mention folding, reverse and thrust faulting, and perhaps tectonic foliation. They should not mention normal faulting.

	3.	Explain how the mountains in the Basin and Range Province were formed?

ANS:	
The mountains in the Basin and Range Province are the result of continental rifting processes. As the crust is pulled apart via tensional stress, the plate begins to thin. Much of this thinning is accommodated by normal faulting within the rift basin. A series of fault-block mountains is created as blocks of crust rotate down along normal faults, producing the series of basins and mountain ranges typical of the Basin and Range Province.

	4.	Explain what the ultimate fate is of all mountains on Earth?

ANS:	
The ultimate fate of any mountain on Earth is to erode away completely and become part of the rock cycle again.

	5.	The Appalachian Mountains were formed due to the collision of North America and Africa at the end of the Paleozoic era. Describe what the Appalachians looked like when formed and what has caused them to become a series of gently sloping hills today?

ANS:	
The Appalachian Mountains probably looked very similar to the Himalayan Mountainsâ€”very tall, steep slopes and rugged, towering peaks. Erosion and orogenic collapse have slowly unroofed the metamorphic core and subdued the topography.
