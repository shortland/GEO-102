SHORT ANSWER

1. Is a piece of concrete a rock? Why or why not?

ANS:
No, concrete is a man-made substance and therefore is not a rock, according to the definition.

DIF:EasyREF:A.2OBJ:Understand the geologic definition of rock.
MSC:Understanding

2. Which of the images below shows a rock? Explain your reasoning.


Figure A
Figure B


ANS:
Figure B shows a rock because it is solid, coherent, and composed of an aggregate of minerals. Figure A is not a rock because it shows a collection of unconsolidated sediment.

3. List the three main rock groups and give a brief description of how each is formed.

ANS:
Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of molten material. Sedimentary rocks are formed by the cementing of sediments or precipitation of minerals from a solution. Metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting another rock to different heat and pressure conditions.

4. Give the definition of rock texture.

ANS:
Rock texture is the size, shape, or arrangement of grains in a rock.

5. How is a thin section made, and what is it used for?

ANS:
A thin section is made by taking a small slice of the rock and gluing it to a slide. The piece of rock on the slide is then ground down until it is so thin that light can pass through it. The thin section is then placed on a petrographic microscope and viewed under magnification and/or orientations of light in order to identify the minerals.
