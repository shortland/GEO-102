SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Compare and contrast unidirectional change with cyclic change. Include an example of each in your answer.

ANS:	
While both describe pathways of change on Earth, unidirectional change flows only in one direction and thus cannot be reversed. Cyclic change consists of a series of steps that can lead back to the original circumstances. For example, the hydrologic cycle describes how water changes and moves through the various reservoirs on Earth, allowing for the water to return to the conditions under which it started. The evolution of life, however, occurs only in one direction. As individuals change to adapt to their surroundings, those changes become part of the DNA of the species and cannot be reversed.

DIF:	Moderate	REF:	19.2 | 19.3	
OBJ:	Understand that some changes are unidirectional, while others are cyclic, and that changes happen at different rates.		MSC:	Analyzing

	2.	Describe the changes that occur to a drop of water as it progresses through the following reservoirs in the hydrologic cycle: ocean, atmosphere, mountains, streams, ocean.

ANS:	
The drop of water in the ocean evaporates to become water vapor in the atmosphere. Once the conditions are right, the water in the atmosphere will condense to form rain drops that fall on the mountains. The rain drops will run off the ground surface and into streams, which will flow out of the mountains and spill out into the ocean.

	3.	What role do greenhouse gases play in Earth’s climate? If there were no greenhouse gases on Earth, what would the climate be like? Could humans survive?

ANS:	
Greenhouse gases work to absorb the reradiated heat from Earth and trap it in the atmosphere, thus warming the climate. If there were no greenhouse gases Earth would be a very cold and inhospitable place, one in which humans certainly could not survive.

	4.	According to the graph below, global temperatures are predicted to rise by as much as 4.5°C. What effect will this have on the area in which you live? Make sure to address the changes you might notice.


ANS:	
Answers will vary; however, if the area is very close to the coasts, then the coasts will flood. If the area normally receives snow, then it may no longer receive any snowfall. If the area is in a desert, then droughts may be enhanced. If the area is normally affected by large seasonal storms, those storms will become stronger.

	5.	List and describe one way humans have impacted Earth.

ANS:	
Answers will vary; however, students might address changes to the landscape due to construction or farming or the effects of deforestation, desertification, and urbanization on the surrounding ecosystem. They may also discuss the pollution of waterways, the contamination of the surface by radioactive substances, and destruction of habitats by deforestation or urban expansion. The addition of chemicals from the burning of fossils fuels and the use of CFCs have created smog and the hole in the ozone, which have also led to the production of acid rain.
