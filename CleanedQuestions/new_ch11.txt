SHORT ANSWER

1. Describe how fossils can be used to interpret the geologic history of an area.

ANS:
Fossils are evidence of past life and therefore will show what types of organisms inhabited an area. This can determine what type of environments have existed during geologic time. For example, we know that certain types of dinosaurs live only on land; thus, if we find evidence of a land-dwelling dinosaur we know that the area was above sea level sometime between 299 and 65 Ma. If the particular dinosaur has been dated we can narrow the age range even more.



2. What caused the buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere at roughly 2.5 Ga?

ANS:
Photosynthetic organisms produced more oxygen than could be absorbed or dissolved by other environments. This caused a rapid buildup in the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere.



3. Describe the circumstances that led to the formation of true continental crust during the Archean.

ANS:
During the Hadean, Earth was too hot to host anything more than thin rafts of crust that remelted almost as soon as they formed. However, Earth had cooled significantly by the Archean, which allowed for the partial melting of the ultramafic melt. This partial melting led to the formation of a more buoyant rock called basalt that floated higher in the lava seas and was finally able to survive long enough to begin accreting onto other pieces of basalt crust.



4. How were mammals able to take over as the dominant class of organisms on Earth?

ANS:
Mammals were able to take over after the dinosaurs were wiped out. The small rodent-like mammals from the Mesozoic were able to adapt and fill the ecological niches left by the dinosaurs.



5. List the major orogenies that formed the Appalachian Mountains in eastern North America. Then explain which orogeny likely produced the largest mountain range, and why.

ANS:
Taconic, Acadian, Alleghanian. The Alleghanian orogeny produced the largest mountain range because it involved the collision of two very large continents, North America and Africa.
