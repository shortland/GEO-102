SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Describe how explosive eruptions occur. Make sure to address viscosity, gas content, and the process for building pressure.

ANS:	
Explosive eruptions occur when high viscosity magma sticks and clogs up the conduit. This causes an increase in gas pressure behind the plug. When the gas pressure is high enough to overcome the friction of the conduit plug, the magma will burst out of the vent violently.

DIF:	Moderate	REF:	5.2	
OBJ:	Understand that not all eruptions are alike—some yield streams of lava, while others produce catastrophic explosions.		MSC:	Understanding		

	2.	The style of eruption depends on the plate tectonic setting in which the volcano is situated. Compare the different eruption styles you would observe at a divergent versus a convergent plate boundary. Make sure to address composition, viscosity, gas content, and so on in your answer.

ANS:	
Eruptions at divergent plate boundaries are effusive. They involve quiet lava flows that produce pillow basalts. The magma composition is generally mafic and thus generally has a low viscosity, which allows the lava to flow easily. Convergent plate boundaries tend to be associated with more explosive eruptions (however, effusive are also possible). The magma compositions tend to contain more silica and thus have a higher viscosity. This high viscosity can often cause the thick, sticky magma to clog up the volcanic conduit, trapping gas under the plug. Gas pressure will then begin to build up until the pressure is high enough to cause an explosion.

OBJ:	Understand how the type of an eruption reflects the character of lava, which in turn depends on the geologic setting.			MSC:	Analyzing

	3.	List and describe two volcanic hazards, including both a description of the hazard and the possible effects of the hazard.

ANS:	
Answers will vary extensively. However, some possible answers are below.
a) Lava flows are effusive eruptions of hot, molten lava that can sometimes flow for very long distances. Lava flows tend to move slow enough to move out of the way of a flow and as such the main hazard associated with lava flows is fire. Structures that cannot be relocated will catch on fire when the lava flow is very near and can often burn to the ground.

b) Pyroclastic falls occur after explosive eruptions when pyroclastic material is blown up into the air and then rains down on the surrounding countryside. As the ash is cooled by the time it reaches the ground the hazards associated with pyroclastic fall include collapsed roofs, buried crops, and damage to machinery with moving parts (including flying airplanes).

c) Pyroclastic flows are massive, incandescent clouds of rolling ash, gas, and other debris that flow down hillsides at very fast speeds. These clouds are instantaneously deadly, as they incinerate whatever is in their paths.

d) Lahars are volcanic mudflows that can occur during an eruption or even years after an eruption. The lahar itself is composed of ash and water (melted glacier, storms, etc.) and has the consistency of wet cement. They move very quickly down valleys and canyons and can bury entire towns in seconds. Lahars are also capable of picking up and carrying away large objects such as entire forests, houses, bridges, and so on.

e) Volcanic gases released from the volcano can pose a significant threat to people and animals nearby. Although water vapor is the most abundant gas released, large quantities of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid are also released and can be toxic to those nearby.

	4.	Recurrence intervals are often used as estimates of when the next eruption might occur. Explain what a recurrence interval is, how it is calculated, and why it is not the most useful means of forecasting eruptions.

ANS:	
A recurrence interval is the average time between eruptions. It is calculated by taking the total number of years between the first and last eruption and dividing it by the total number of eruptions. The problem with recurrence intervals calculated for volcanic eruptions is that there are generally only a very small number of eruptions for which we have data and thus the average calculated contains a large amount of error.

	5.	Describe how an explosive volcanic eruption can create a global cooling event.

ANS:	
Explosive eruptions produce ash that can be pushed far up into the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere the ash will reflect sunlight that will in turn lower the global temperature.
