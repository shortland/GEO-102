SHORT ANSWER

	1.	What are the similarities and differences between physical and chemical weathering. Make sure to address both what is the same and what is different.

ANS:	
Physical and chemical weathering are both working to break down rocks into smaller pieces. Physical weathering involves the mechanical breaking of rocks by jointing or wedging processes; however, there is no alteration of the mineral makeup of the rock. Chemical weathering involves breaking up a rock by changing the chemical makeup of the rock. Chemical weathering involves the dissolving of minerals to form ions in solution or the stripping away of electrons from atoms during the oxidation process, both of which change the chemical makeup of the rock.

	2.	Describe how physical and chemical weathering can work together to break down rocks.

ANS:	
If a rock is broken apart mechanically there is more surface area exposed to the elements. The more surface area exposed, the more area can be attacked by chemical weathering. This in turn weakens the rocks so that they can be more easily broken by physical weathering processes, thus creating even more surface area for chemical weathering.

	3.	Describe the difference between sediment and soil.

ANS:	
Sediment consists of loose broken rock, mineral, or shell fragments. Soil contains sediment that has been progressively broken down and mixed with organic materials to form something that can sustain life.

	4.	Label the different soil horizons on the image below, then provide a brief description of each horizon next to the corresponding layer.


ANS:	
See image below for correct labels. Soil horizon descriptions: O-horizon is the thin top layer that contains mainly organic material. The A-horizon contains more heavily decayed organic material mixed with clay, silt, and sand. The E-horizon has been extensively leached and contains little to no organic material. The B-horizon is where ions and clays that were leached from the O-, A-, and E-horizons end up. The C-horizon contains weathered bedrock but has not been subjected to leaching or accumulation. Below the C-horizon is competent bedrock.

	5.	List one factor that controls the thickness of soil and describe how the thickness is controlled.

ANS:	
Answers will vary but may include the following: 

Climate controls soil thickness by controlling the amount of rainfall and temperature of an area; the more humid and warm an area is the more likely you will have plentiful chemical weathering and plants and microbes to produce organic material.

The composition of the rock on which the soil forms will control the thickness because different minerals have different resistances to weathering. Thus, a quartz sandstone is highly resistant to weathering and will form a very thin soil.

The steeper a slope, the thinner the soil will be because the newly weathering rock is more likely to be washed downslope and away from the area.

Wet soils will be thicker for several reasons, including the high rate of chemical weathering, large amount of vegetation growing in the area, and high percentage of microbes and other organisms available to aid in decomposition of material.

Soil takes time to develop; thus, the older a soil is the thicker it will be.

The types of plants and organisms in an area will control soil thickness because more plants mean more organic material and more plentiful organisms that aid in decomposition of matter will produce more organic material.
