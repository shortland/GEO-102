	2.	Describe the plausible geologic history of the rocks in the diagram below.


ANS:	
The sediments that make up the sandstone and shale were most likely deposited along a coast, perhaps near a delta at the edges of a Silurian sea. The sediments were buried and lithified, uplifted, and tilted. The top of the sandstone and shale package was eroded away and then the sediments of the Old Red Sandstone were deposited in a subaerial environment, buried, oxidized, and lithified. The entire package of rocks was then uplifted, tilted, and eroded to its present state.
