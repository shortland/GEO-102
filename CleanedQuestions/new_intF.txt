SHORT ANSWER

1. What is a landform and how is it linked to the landscape?

ANS:
A landform is an individual feature such as a mountain, valley, and so on. Landscapes are the shape of the land surface and thus are composed of landforms.

DIF:ModerateREF:F.1
OBJ:Understand what a landscape is and what questions geologists ask about landscapes.
MSC:Understanding

2. Describe the process that drives the uplift of mountain ranges.

ANS:
Mountain ranges are uplifted by the convergence of two plates, which is ultimately the result of internal energy within the Earth.

DIF:ModerateREF:F.2
OBJ:Understand the difference between uplift and subsidence and the forces that drive them.
MSC:Understanding

3. What type(s) of energy control(s) erosion? Explain your answer.

ANS:
Erosion is controlled by external and gravitational energy. The external energy controls the climate and weather in an area and gravitational energy controls the mass movement of materials down slopes.

DIF:ModerateREF:F.2
OBJ:Understand the contrasts between internal and external energy in the Earth System.
MSC:Understanding

4. The image below shows the Valles Marineris on Mars. Is this landform depositional or erosional? Explain your answer.


ANS:
The Valles Marineris is a deep canyon that was the result of erosional processes. The students’ explanations will vary but should discuss that canyons are the result of running water removing material and thus are erosional in nature.

5. Starting with a drop of water in the ocean, describe a full cycle of movement of the water drop through the hydrologic cycle (the water must end up back in the ocean). Through what reservoirs does that water move? What physical forms does the water take (e.g., liquid, solid, gas)?

ANS:
Answers will vary but may include: 

Liquid water begins in the ocean, is evaporated to become gas in the atmosphere, moves over a mountain range and condenses to liquid water, falls as rain on the mountains, and drains down a river and out into the ocean.

Liquid water begins in the ocean, is evaporated to become gas in the atmosphere, moves over a mountain range, and condenses to liquid water. The water cools to form solid snowflakes and falls in the mountains; the snow melts in the spring and flows down rivers to the ocean.

Liquid water begins in the ocean, is evaporated to become gas in the atmosphere, moves over a mountain range and condenses to liquid water, falls as rain on the mountains, infiltrates into the groundwater system, and flows back out into the ocean.
