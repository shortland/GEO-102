SHORT ANSWER

1. Label the glaciers in the image below using words from the word bank included (hint: not all the names will be used).
Piedmont glacier

Cirque glacier
Continental glacier
Valley glacier
Ice apron
Tidewater glacier
Hanging glacier
Mountain ice cap


ANS:
See image below.




2. What are the circumstances that lead to glacial advance versus glacial retreat? Most glaciers today are in retreat. What does this imply about the glaciers and their environment?

ANS:
In order for a glacier to advance there must be more snow falling in the accumulation zone than there is ice removal in the zone of ablation. Retreating glaciers have more removal of material in the zone of ablation than snowfall in the accumulation zone. Since most glaciers today are in retreat, this means that there is more removal of glacial ice than there is addition of snow to the glacier. This implies that the glaciers are disappearing due to warming of their environment (e.g., the climate).



3. Explain why the deposits made by glacial outwash are stratified.

ANS:
Deposits from outwash plains are stratified because the river is depositing the sediments, not the glacier, and thus the sediments will drop out of the river and be deposited based on the size fraction of the sediments and the rate of flow of the river.



4. Draw a representative eustatic sea level curve you would expect to see for a world that experienced two glacials and three interglacials. Make sure to label your axes and the glacials and interglacials on the graph.

ANS:
Assuming higher sea level is toward the top of the graph, there should be three peaks and two troughs in the drawing. See example below.
       



5. List and describe one short-term cause for glaciations.

ANS:
Answer will vary but may cover the following topics. 

The Milankovitch cycles describe the variation in Earth’s position relative to the Sun, with changes in the tilt, eccentricity, and precession of Earth. The summation of all three cycles can lead to Earth receiving relatively more solar insolation, which in turn can help to spur a change in Earth’s climate. 

Changes in the reflectivity, or albedo, of Earth due to changes in the amount of snow can cause more (or less) solar insulation to be reflected back into space. 

Disruption of sea currents can also lead to a shift in climate by forcing changes in the sea surface temperature, such as decreasing the temperature at the poles and allowing glaciers to form.

Increases or decreases in greenhouse gases due to biological processes can also shift the climate; one example of this is the decrease in CO2 during the Middle Carboniferous Period, which led to a period of global cooling during the Late Carboniferous Period.

Changes in the output of solar radiation by the Sun changes the amount of insolation Earth receives and thus can either warm or cool the planet.
