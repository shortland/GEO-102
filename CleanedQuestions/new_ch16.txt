SHORT ANSWER

1. What are porosity and permeability, and how do they affect the rate of groundwater flow?

ANS:
Porosity refers to the pore spaces within rock, while permeability refers to how interconnected the pore spaces are. Ultimately, if the porosity and permeability are both high, then the rate of groundwater flow will be high. If they are both low, then the rate will be very low as well.



2. Label the three zones that water moves through as it percolates into Earth on the image below. Also include where the water table is by marking it with an arrow.


ANS:
Students should label the unsaturated zone, capillary fringe, and saturated zone. The arrow for the water table is at the top of the saturated zone. See image below for answers. 




3. The images below are of two different geological scenarios in which springs could form. Describe the similarities and differences between these two scenarios.


ANS:
The images both show how impermeable layers can restrict groundwater flow and create springs. However, in image A the fault has juxtaposed permeable, water-bearing layers against impermeable rock, thus forcing the water to the surface along the fault. In image B water that percolates down from the surface reaches the impermeable layer and must flow along the top surface of the impermeable layer until it seeps out of the hillside in a spring. One situation is tectonically created; the other is due to the stratigraphy itself.



4. List and describe one possible effect from overpumping.

ANS:
Answers will vary; however, possible topics include lowering the water table, reversing the flow of groundwater, saline intrusion, and land subsidence. If more water is pumped out of the ground than can be replaced by natural flow, the level of the water table will lower. Effects include drying out of the surface land and causing other nearby wells to become dry. Overpumping can cause a reversal of groundwater flow due to the cone of depression forming a localized slope that could force contaminates to flow in a different direction. Overpumping on the coast can often remove the upper layer of fresh groundwater and begin pumping the more dense saline water below. This can result in the abandonment of wells and may result in the permanent contamination of the groundwater in the area. As the water table is lowered due to overpumping, the pore spaces in the rock, which are now no longer held up by water, may collapse, resulting in the subsidence of the ground surface and a permanent decrease in the capacity of the aquifer.



5. Explain how caves are formed, making sure to include the name of the acid involved and how it forms.

ANS:
Caves are formed when carbonic acid dissolves away limestone bedrock. The carbonic acid is created when water interacts with carbon dioxide. The carbonic acid then begins to dissolve away the limestone, producing bicarbonate and calcium ions. Caves most often form at the water table; however, they may form just above it.
