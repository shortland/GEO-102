SHORT ANSWER

1. Describe the difference between lithification and diagenesis.

ANS:
Lithification is the transformation of loose sediment into intact sedimentary rock via compaction and cementation. Diagenesis is the process (chemical, biological, or physical) by which any sedimentary rock is produced.



2. Describe the depositional environment that formed the layers shown in the image below.


ANS:
The image shows a sequence of red sandstones and shales. The sandstones were likely formed along a beach, while the shales were formed in a more muddy environment. Since both contain iron (red staining), they were formed in a subaerial environment. The environment was most likely a delta.



3. Limestone can be either a biochemical or a chemical sedimentary rock. Explain how both types of limestone are formed. Make sure to describe the environments in which they were formed.

ANS:
Fossiliferous limestone is generally formed in shallow marine environments, often near reefs. Travertine is a form of chemical limestone and can be formed in several ways, one of which is in caves as speleothems or other cave formations. Travertine can also be formed along carbonate terraces such as those at hot springs.



4. What traits would a clastic sedimentary rock have if it had traveled far from its source and was carried in a current with uniform energy? What environment would this be?

ANS:
A clastic rock that had traveled far from its source and carried in a uniform energy current would have well-rounded, well-sorted sediment that would contain very stable minerals such as quartz. This environment would be a beach.



5. In which of the following three basin types might you be able to find oil forming and why? Rift basin, passive-margin basin, and foreland basin.

ANS:
Passive-margin basins are formed in shallow marine environments, which would allow for the accumulation of organic-rich sediments that could potentially turn into oil.
