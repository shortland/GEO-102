3. List and describe two volcanic hazards, including both a description of the hazard and the possible effects of the hazard.
a) Lava flows are effusive eruptions of hot, molten lava that can sometimes flow for very long distances. Lava flows tend to move slow enough to move out of the way of a flow and as such the main hazard associated with lava flows is fire. Structures that cannot be relocated will catch on fire when the lava flow is very near and can often burn to the ground.
b) Pyroclastic falls occur after explosive eruptions when pyroclastic material is blown up into the air and then rains down on the surrounding countryside. As the ash is cooled by the time it reaches the ground the hazards associated with pyroclastic fall include collapsed roofs, buried crops, and damage to machinery with moving parts (including flying airplanes).
c) Pyroclastic flows are massive, incandescent clouds of rolling ash, gas, and other debris that flow down hillsides at very fast speeds. These clouds are instantaneously deadly, as they incinerate whatever is in their paths.
d) Lahars are volcanic mudflows that can occur during an eruption or even years after an eruption. The lahar itself is composed of ash and water (melted glacier, storms, etc.) and has the consistency of wet cement. They move very quickly down valleys and canyons and can bury entire towns in seconds. Lahars are also capable of picking up and carrying away large objects such as entire forests, houses, bridges, and so on.
ANS:

4. Recurrence intervals are often used as estimates of when the next eruption might occur. Explain what a recurrence interval is, how it is calculated, and why it is not the most useful means of forecasting eruptions.
