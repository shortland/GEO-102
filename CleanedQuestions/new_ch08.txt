SHORT ANSWER

1. Why do deep-focus earthquakes occur along convergent plate boundaries? Why do they not occur along divergent or transform boundaries?

ANS:
As cold subducting crust moves down into Earth, the changes in pressure and temperature cause bands of earthquakes to occur along the down-going slab. Neither divergent or transform boundaries reach deep enough to host deep-focus earthquakes.



2. How is the Mercalli intensity scale used to determine the magnitude of an earthquake? What errors might be associated with this technique?

ANS:
The Mercalli intensity scale uses the testimony of “felt damage” from those who experienced the earthquake. The severity of the damage is then ranked according to a scale and plotted on a map. There are many problems with this technique; however, the main issue is that testimonies can be very subjective among a group of people.



3. Explain why tsunamis are NOT tidal waves.

ANS:
Tsunamis are created by large displacements of water due to earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions. The size and severity of a tsunami wave is influenced only by the size of the displacement and the distance the wave travels, not by the tides. In other words, a tsunami that strikes during low tide will be just as dangerous and cover just as much shoreline in water as a tsunami that strikes during high tide.



4. Why is an early warning system NOT considered a short-term earthquake prediction tool?

ANS:
Early warning systems warn of an earthquake in progress, not of an earthquake that will form in the future.



5. Why is an empty field the safest place to be in an earthquake?

ANS:
Ground motion alone is very unlikely to hurt someone; the main sources of injury are the structures we build that fall on us. Therefore, the safest place to be in an earthquake is out in the middle of a field with nothing else around.
