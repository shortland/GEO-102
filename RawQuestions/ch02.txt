SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Explain why Wegener’s theory of continental drift was not originally accepted by geologists of his time?

ANS:	
Wegener could not provide a plausible mechanism for the movement of continents. He proposed that centrifugal force caused the continents to plow through the oceans. However, the magnitude of centrifugal force produced by the rotation of Earth is not sufficient to move such large masses. In addition, the continental crust is much too weak to plow through the much stronger oceanic crust.

OBJ:	Understand Wegener’s evidence for continental drift.	MSC:	Understanding

	2.	Describe the process of seafloor spreading, making sure to address why the diameter of Earth is not growing.

ANS:	
As plates move apart at a divergent plate boundary, magma rises into the new space, erupting at the surface to form pillow basalts and cooling along the sides of the fracture to form gabbro dikes. These pillow basalts and gabbro dikes become new oceanic crusts that then move away from each other, and again more magma moves toward the surface to start the process again. This slowly moves the plates apart, forming new oceanic crust and new ocean basins. The newly formed crust is balanced by the recycling of old oceanic crust into subduction zones at convergent boundaries on the opposite sides of ocean basins.

	3.	Plate tectonics theory is often referred to as the “unifying” theory in geology. Explain why plate tectonics is such an important theory to the study of Earth.

ANS:	
There are many good answers to this; however, a few good answers might reference how before plate tectonics we did not really understand how mountains formed, why volcanoes formed where they did, why earthquakes occur where they do, and so on. Plate tectonics also allows us to explain how and why rocks move through the rock cycle, how oceans form, or why marine fossils can be found at the top of Mount Everest. Any good answer will explain that before the theory of plate tectonics there were very many processes we did not understand, and since plate tectonic theory has been around we have been able to explain many of these processes.

	4.	Discuss where transform boundaries are primarily found and what their main purpose is.

ANS:	
Transform boundaries are primarily found along mid-ocean ridges (MORs); however, they do appear on land in several places around the globe. The main purpose of transform boundaries is to break the MOR into smaller segments, which allows the spreading of the plates at MORs to be accommodated on the three-dimensional, spherical surface of Earth.
