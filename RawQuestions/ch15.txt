	2.	Describe what thermohaline circulation is and how it works.

ANS:	
Thermohaline circulation is the vertical movement of ocean water due to changes in density. Cold or salty water has a high density that causes it to sink toward the bottom of the ocean. The water then circulates along the ocean bottom until it becomes less dense, either by warming up or by decreasing the salinity, and rises to the surface. This process mixes the oceans vertically.

MSC:	Understanding		

	3.	Describe what longshore drift is and how it works.

ANS:	
Longshore drift is the movement of sediment along the beach. Longshore drift occurs when waves come into the beach at an angle and wash the sand diagonally up the beach. The wave returns to the ocean straight down the slope due to the pull of gravity and carries the sand along with it. Thus, overall the sand on the beach moves in a zigzag pattern down the beach in the direction of longshore drift.

	4.	Explain why it is not a good idea to build on barrier islands.

ANS:	
Barrier islands are temporary features because the sand they are composed of is constantly moving due to longshore drift. Any structures built on barrier islands can be undermined by the constant erosion of sand.

	5.	Describe one way humans have tried to mitigate beach erosion. Was it ultimately successful in both the short term and long term?

ANS:	
Answers will vary; however, students may discuss beach nourishment or the use of hard stabilization structures. Beach nourishment involves placing new sediment onto the beach to replace the eroded sand. Beach nourishment can be effective in the short term; however, it does not stop the erosion from occurring and will need to be used again at a later date. Hard stabilization structures like groins, jetties, or breakwaters prevent erosion at a specific spot but shift the erosion to another nearby spot. This will fix the issue both short and long term; however, it will cause problems for other areas along the beach, which may ultimately cause different problems (i.e., legal issues). Riprap or seawalls are hard structures made of concrete or large boulders that are meant to absorb the energy from waves and prevent erosion. However, these structures can be undermined and destroyed by large storms and thus are a measure that will need to be repaired often.
