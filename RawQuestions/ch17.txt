SHORT ANSWER

	1.	What is a desert? Explain how a desert could be formed at one of the poles.

ANS:	
A desert is an arid area that receives less than 25 cm of rain per year and contains 15% or less vegetation. Deserts form in cold regions because cold air does not hold much moisture; thus, cold regions are very arid.

DIF:	Moderate	REF:	17.2	
OBJ:	Understand why certain regions are classified as deserts, and what factors cause these regions to be arid.	MSC:	Understanding		

	2.	What is the dominant erosional force in deserts, wind or water? Why?

ANS:	
Water is the dominant erosional force in deserts despite the fact that so little rain falls in deserts because the rain will often cause torrents of water to wash down streambeds. This large amount of water can erode and transport large amounts of sediment very quickly.

DIF:	Moderate	REF:	17.3	
OBJ:	Understand how weathering and erosional processes in deserts differ from those in temperate lands.	MSC:	Understanding

	3.	Describe the differences between lag deposits and desert pavement.

ANS:	
Lag deposits are layers of large cobbles and pebbles that form a surface in the desert, while desert pavement is a layer of smaller rocks that cover a soil layer. Lag deposits are formed by the removal of small particles of sediment by the wind in a process called deflation. The larger particles (cobbles, pebbles, gravel) are left behind while the smaller particles (sand, silt, clay) are picked up and carried away by the wind. Desert pavement forms when larger particles (cobbles and pebbles) collect in an area and dust begins to settle among the cobbles and pebbles to form a soil layer beneath. The cobbles and pebbles are eventually broken down into smaller pieces by heat and form a layer of smaller stones on the surface.

	5.	Imagine you are a farmer moving into the Great Plains area after the Dust Bowl of 1933. What can you do to make the land fertile enough for farming again? What about grazing of livestock?

ANS:	
Answers will vary, but students might mention adding organic material or fertilizer to the soil, irrigating the soil, or planting native crops to allow for farming again. For grazing they may mention the same things as above, but also planting native grasses/plants might be added.
