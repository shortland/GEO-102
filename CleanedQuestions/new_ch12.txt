SHORT ANSWER

1. Coal gasification has sometimes been referred to as “clean coal.” Explain why coal gasification is not as “clean” as its name might suggest.

ANS:
Coal gasification does not produce nearly as much CO2 as the straight burning of coal; however, the by-products are still toxic and often must be handled as hazardous waste. Some by-products may be reused to produce other products (such as cleaning chemicals), but they are still considered hazardous to humans.



2. Describe how oil is formed. Make sure to address what organisms must accumulate, in what environment they must be deposited, and how the oil window effects the formation.

ANS:
Oil is formed when microscopic plankton die and accumulate in an anoxic environment on the ocean floor. As more and more layers of sediment are deposited on top of the plankton-rich layer, the temperature increases and chemical reactions begin to turn the organic material into kerogen. If the kerogen-rich layer is heated to between 90° and 150°C, the kerogen will break down into oil and gas molecules.



3. Gold is often found at the bottom of streambeds in placer deposits. Describe the process that forms these deposits.

ANS:
As gold-bearing deposits weather away the sediment, composed of sand and gold flakes or nuggets, the gold-bearing sediment is transported to the stream that carries the lighter minerals away and leaves the heavier gold behind. After time a deposit of gold will form in the bed of the stream that can then be buried or become part of the rock record or be panned out by gold prospectors.



4. What are two renewable energy resources that could be used in your city/state? List both and describe A) how the energy is formed, B) the best geographic location for the energy source, and C) what the drawbacks of each energy source are.

ANS:
Depends entirely upon location used; however, some examples are given here. 

Solar energy uses sunlight to produce energy either by heating or by inducing the flow of electrons between wafers in a solar panel. Solar energy works best in areas that receive plenty of sunlight year-round; however, if sunlight is too diffuse (in areas that are very rainy, for instance), then solar may not be as useful. In addition, it is not yet feasible to store large amounts of solar energy for use during dark periods, such as at night, and therefore solar needs to be supplemented with additional energy sources.

Wind energy uses the wind to turn large propellers that then rotate the turbine to generate electricity. Wind energy is best used in large flat expanses that receive large amounts of wind (including areas offshore). Wind, like solar, only generates power when the wind is blowing; on calm days there is no electricity produced. Also, wind fields cover large expanses of land and can be an eyesore for some. Wind turbines have been known to be noisy, though the newer models combat this issue well. 
Wind turbines can also kill birds and bats, though how much of an impact this is having on 
the animal populations is still unknown and currently being studied by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

Geothermal energy uses Earth’s internal heat to produce steam that in turn runs turbines that generate electricity. Geothermal power can only be used in areas where there is a high amount of heat flow from the Earth, such as near magma sources. There are several places within the United States that have the capacity to utilize geothermal energy, many of which are on the West Coast and in Alaska. The main downside to this energy source is that it is only available in a few areas around the world.

Hydroelectric power uses the potential energy in flowing water to spin turbines that generate electricity. This type of energy production must be near a source of flowing water such as a river or the ocean. Downsides are that dams can alter the ecosystem of a river significantly by flooding habitats and blocking the flow of sediment down the river. Dams can also significantly change the amount of water flowing down a river, thus impacting the areas downstream. Tidal dams use the change from high tide, which fills the area behind the dam, to low tide, which allows the water to escape via an outlet fitted with a turbine. Tidal dams have come up against issues due to their potential impact on tourism and possible impact on marine wildlife and coastal ecosystems.



5. Despite the fact that nonrenewable energy resources will eventually run out and that many tend to be large sources of pollution, why are they still used so prevalently in our society?

ANS:
Fossil fuels are still used in abundance because they are cheap and our society is already set up to use them; thus, they are also easy. Nuclear power is expensive and dangerous; however, it yields a massive amount of energy that goes a long way toward feeding our societies’ thirst for energy.
