SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Describe the process of decompression melting; be sure to include an example of where this type of melting occurs within Earth.

ANS:	
Decompression melting occurs at divergent boundaries (mid-ocean ridges and rifts) and in mantle plumes when mantle rock is subjected to a decrease in pressure. The decrease in pressure allows the atoms more space to move, which in turn begins to break chemical bonds, turning a solid into a liquid.

	3.	Describe the difference between the relative viscosity of felsic versus mafic magma and how this affects the rate of flow of each type.

ANS:	
Felsic magma has a high viscosity whereas mafic magma has a low viscosity. Magma with a high viscosity, such as felsic magmas, will flow much more slowly than those with a lower viscosity, such as mafic magma.
