	3.	Why are minerals often referred to as “the building blocks of Earth”?

ANS:	
Earth is made of many different types of rocks, and rocks are composed of a mixture of minerals in various forms. Thus, the smallest “building block” of Earth is actually the mineral.

	4.	Some physical properties are more useful for certain minerals than others. Explain how color can be useful to identify some minerals but not others. Be sure to use mineral examples in your answer.

ANS:	
Some minerals, like olivine, are always the same color. However, other minerals, such as quartz, come in a variety of colors, and thus color is not a useful physical property to use to identify quartz.

	5.	Diamond is a polymorph of graphite. What is a polymorph, and explain how a piece of graphite could be turned into a diamond by geologic processes.

ANS:	
A polymorph is a mineral with the same chemical composition but a different crystal structure. If graphite is buried down deep enough into Earth the pressure will cause the bonds between carbons to rearrange, strengthening the crystal and turning it into a diamond.
