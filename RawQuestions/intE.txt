SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Explain how the leaves in the image below were formed.


ANS:	
The leaves died and fell off the plant and were buried by layers of sediment; the organic material decayed and left a thin film of carbon in the shape of the original leaves.

DIF:	Easy	REF:	E.2	OBJ:	Understand what a fossil is, and how fossils form.
MSC:	Applying

	2.	Explain why the fossil record is incomplete.

ANS:	
The fossil record is incomplete because not all organisms are preserved. The majority of fossils 
are of organisms with hard parts, and thus we are missing many soft-bodied organisms. In addition, organisms must be subjected to specific conditions in order to be preserved, and thus very few organisms overall are preserved. Lastly, we have simply not found every fossil on Earth yet.

DIF:	Moderate	REF:	E.4	
OBJ:	Understand that it takes special conditions for an organism to be preserved as a fossil, so it’s not surprising that the record of known fossils is very incomplete.

	4.	Explain how evolution by natural selection occurs.

ANS:	
Organisms that are best adapted to survive in their environment will be the only ones that will be able to reproduce and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring. Thus, those that are “the fittest” will survive and the weakest will die off.

	5.	How is mass extinction different from extinction?

ANS:	
An extinction occurs when the last member of a species dies. A mass extinction occurs when a large number of organisms die at once.
