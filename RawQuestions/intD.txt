SHORT ANSWER

	1.	If a P-wave is traveling from a layer of mantle peridotite to a layer of limestone crust, what will happen to the P-wave in terms of speed and direction of motion?

ANS:	
The P-wave will slow down and be refracted away from the boundary between the layers.

	2.	Using the image below, explain why Ray M arrives at the seismometer before Ray C.


ANS:	
Ray C travels within the crust, which has a lower velocity than the mantle. Ray M travels for most of its path in the faster mantle layer and thus will overtake Ray C and arrive at the seismometer first.

	3.	Using the image below, explain why the P-wave velocity drops drastically at the core-mantle boundary. Also, explain why the P-wave velocity speeds up at the inner core–outer core boundary.


ANS:	
The P-wave velocity drops at the core-mantle boundary because the outer core is a liquid and P-waves slow down when they enter liquids. The P-wave speeds up when passing from the inner to the outer core for the same reason; the P-wave goes from low-velocity liquid to higher-velocity solid.

	4.	Why does a mountain show a positive gravity anomaly?

ANS:	
The mountain contains a large mass of material in one spot; therefore, this will result in a stronger pull of gravity and a positive gravity anomaly.

	5.	Large portions of the state of Utah are composed of thick sequences of sedimentary rocks. Would the magnetic anomaly be positive or negative? Why?

ANS:	
The magnetic anomaly over a package of sedimentary rocks would be negative because the rocks do not contain any magnetic minerals and thus will not add to Earth’s magnetic field in the area.
