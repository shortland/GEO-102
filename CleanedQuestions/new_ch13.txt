SHORT ANSWER

1. Describe the similarities and differences between a debris flow and a debris slide.

ANS:
Both types of landslides are composed of the same types of materials: larger particles mixed with regolith. However, debris flows contain abundant water, while debris slides contain much less water and may entrain lots of air as they move.



2. Describe the factors that affect the resistance force and how they affect the stability of the slope.

ANS:
The resistance force is affected by the angle of the slope, the material of which the slope is made, the amount of water within the soil, and the material on which the slide block is resting. If the angle of the slope is steep, then the resisting force is lower than the downslope force. The size, shape, and type of material of which the slope is made affects the stability by changing the repose angle and cohesion of the material. If small amounts of water are in the slope, this will increase the cohesion of the soil and decrease the likelihood of slope failure; however, large amounts of water will increase the chances of a mass wasting event. The material on which the potential slide block rests will affect the resistance force by changing the frictional force of the material, the more slippery the material (e.g., wet clay), the more likely there will be a slope failure.



3. Explain why time is often the most effective landslide trigger.

ANS:
Slopes become weaker as time progresses due to continuous weathering of the slope. Therefore, sometimes all that is needed to trigger a landslide is enough time to weaken the slope beyond the point of failure.



4. Why would Florida, which receives plentiful rainfall and remains humid for a large portion of the year, be less susceptible to landslides than the California desert?

ANS:
Florida is very flat and therefore less susceptible to landslides; the California desert contains many mountainous regions and thus has a higher landslide potential.



5. Pick two ways of mitigating landslide hazards and describe how they work and what issues they may have?

ANS:
Answers will vary; the important thing is that the student defends his or her position. Many methods of mitigation require regular maintenance (e.g., rock bolts, riprap, etc.), while some may require changes in land use or zoning to prevent the removal of vegetation or drains or the building of structures next to diverted channels or on top of terraces.
