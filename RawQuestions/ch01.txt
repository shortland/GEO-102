SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Why was Pluto removed from the list of planets in our solar system?

ANS:	
Pluto has not cleared its orbit of all debris and thus no longer qualifies as a planet according to the new definition.

	2.	Scientist have estimated the age of Earth to be 4.57 Ga. What did they use to determine this age and why did they use it?

ANS:	
The age of Earth was determined by radiometric age dating of meteorites. Rocks from Earth have been recycled so much that we no longer have any rocks that date back to the formation of Earth. However, since everything in the solar system was created at the same time, and meteorites have not been recycled since their formation, meteorite samples were used to determine the age of the solar system.
