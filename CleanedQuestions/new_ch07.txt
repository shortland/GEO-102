SHORT ANSWER

1. Metamorphism includes a solid-state change in a rock due to heat, pressure, and/or hydrothermal fluids. Explain what is meant by solid-state change.

ANS:
A solid-state change takes place when the rock is solid, in other words the rock has not been melted or weathered into a solution. All changes in size, shape, or composition of minerals is done while the rock remains solid.



2. Describe the resulting metamorphism that occurs next to an igneous intrusion.

ANS:
A metamorphic aureole forms next to an intrusion. Each layer of the aureole has progressively lower-grade metamorphism the farther away from the intrusion it is. The metamorphism created by the intrusion is called thermal metamorphism or contact metamorphism and takes place in the absence of pressure.



3. Draw the orientation of the preferential stress that created the foliation in the image below.


ANS:
See image below. Red arrows indicate stress orientation.




4. During dynamothermal metamorphism several metamorphic processes are at work. Describe these processes and what effect they might have on the rocks subjected to metamorphism.

ANS:
Dynamothermal metamorphism occurs in the cores of mountain ranges and thus subjects rocks to changes in heat, pressure, and preferential stresses. Temperatures increase within the cores of mountains due to the geothermal gradient and igneous intrusions; this will cause changes in the mineral assemblages of the rocks including recrystallization and neocrystallization. Rocks within mountain cores are also subjected to high pressures due to increased overburden, compression, and shear stress. The increase in stress and pressure on the rocks will work to align minerals (by rotation and plastic deformation) to the preferred orientation and may also cause pressure solution to occur along grain boundaries.



5. Metamorphic grade describes the intensity or degree of metamorphism. The metamorphic grade of a rock is determined mainly by the temperature and amount of recrystallization or neocrystallization to which a rock is subjected. List the following rocks in order from low-grade to high-grade metamorphic rocks and then describe the changes seen in the suite of rocks as the grade is increased: gneiss, slate, schist, phyllite, and migmatite.

ANS:
Order from low grade to high grade: slate, phyllite, schist, gneiss, and migmatite. The changes seen in these rocks as they progress from low grade to high grade are primarily in mineral assemblage and size. At the lowest grade, slate contains clay minerals that are preferentially aligned with each other (and the stress direction). As metamorphic grade increases to phyllite the clay minerals begin to recrystallize as mica minerals; however, they remain very small. As the rock progresses to schist the mica minerals continue to grow larger and begin to form a series of wavy layers referred to as schistocity. In addition, it is common to have new minerals form as porphyroblasts. The jump from schist to gneiss shows a separation of light-colored and dark-colored minerals into distinct color bands. Felsic minerals such as quartz and feldspar grow larger as well. If the temperature reaches a bit past the melting point of felsic minerals, then the rock becomes a migmatite with light-colored layers of much larger felsic crystals that have been partially melted and recrystallized.
